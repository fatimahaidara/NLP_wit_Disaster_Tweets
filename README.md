# NLP_wit_Disaster_Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they are observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). 


Within this context explained above, this project has the goal to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t, with access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster, this is why the need for NLP arises which is the ability of a computer to understand human text and process it to give meaningful output.

You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
