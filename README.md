# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they are observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). 


Within this context explained above, this project has the goal to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t, with access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster, this is why the need for NLP arises which is the ability of a computer to understand human text and process it to give meaningful output.

You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
